TODO
====
1. Use better logging (configure externally, log to-file)
2. Commandline client: improvements: use Lanterna library for terminal output
3. Add current user highlight (needs server notification about accepted username)
4. Add observable model; make gui react on model changes (would simplify SevrerProxy)
5. Add icon
